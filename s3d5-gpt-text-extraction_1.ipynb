       "'  Recognizing the evolving digital landscape shaped by technical advancements and socio-technical realities, professionals discussed the impact of digital advancements on Philippine democracy and rights in the Philippine Declaration of Internet Rights and Principles (PhilDec 2.0).      The plenary session of the Digital Rights Conference, held at Ateneo de Manila University last Thursday, March 21, also featured discussions on several key points, including artificial intelligence (AI), human rights, gender, environmental sustainability, and the post-pandemic digital ecosystems.      Alan Alegre, former executive director of the Foundation for Media Alternatives (FMA), along with other information and communications technology (ICT), media and human rights experts, stressed the need for an updated declaration. It addresses challenges made more difficult by the digital economy, such as the digital divide, hijacked democracies, disinformation, and the post-pandemic effects on digital rights and health.      \"The digital economy as we were looking at it in 2015 has changed so much, both from what is developed technologically but also politically,\" Alegre said.\\xa0      In a 14-page draft, Alegre highlighted several newly added principles: addressing disinformation and harmful content to mitigate the harms to democracy and the digital public sphere; the sustainable use of the internet and ICTs amid the climate emergency; addressing power imbalances in digital societies through regulation, content moderation, and transparency; promoting more effective and equitable e-health systems; ICT systems and electoral integrity; and challenges posed by AI.      PhilDec 2.0 also included revisions from the  initial declaration  from 2015, emphasizing: open access to scientific, research, and academic content; addressing gender-based violence online through concrete programs and mechanisms to foster a transformative and safe internet space; and promoting human capital development through education, digital literacy, and e-learning including AI literacy.\\xa0      Alegre expressed hope that PhilDec 2.0 would become a \"strategic reference\" for various stakeholders, guiding its use in public education, policy development, social and political advocacy, and efforts related to gender and AI.      Potentials and perils of AI      Discussing AI literacy, Alegre said the education system is \"broken,\" calling it a challenge that needs to be addressed. Online learning, he added, exacerbated the challenges, revealing disparities in internet access as people share gadgets in barangays and schools.      The Philippines scored among the lowest in the December 2023  Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2022 rankings , placing 77th out of 81 countries. Filipino students continued to struggle in reading, mathematics, and science, positioning the nation near the bottom in these key subjects.      \"It\\'s a challenge, (but) we have to start somewhere, and the specific area of digital is important to build capacity strategically on all levels [such as] literacy, life-long learning, higher education, etc.,\" Alegre said.      For Dominic Ligot, founder of CirroLytix and Data Ethics PH, AI needs to \"become real and tangible to everyone\" as it represents the next evolution of the internet, particularly generative AI.      Ligot advocated the use of AI \"for good\" by starting with risk management. This included recommendations for a discussion on the harms versus benefits of AI, its compliance with laws, and moral principles and guidelines governing the development and deployment of the use of AI technologies.\\xa0      \" Ethics talaga ang bottomline. (Ethics really is the bottomline) , Ligot said. \"Is it fair, is it transparent, and who is accountable? If we can cover those three bases, maybe we can make a difference.\" he added.      Alegre addressed AI\\'s potential perils across economic, political, social, and environmental spheres, including job displacement, algorithmic bias, discrimination, privacy erosion, and the weaponization of AI, especially concerning elections, privacy, and gender issues. This underscores the necessity of a \"human-centered approach\" in AI development and deployment for its promised \"innovation.\"      Towards a ‘human-centered\\' approach      Despite concerns about AI, Alegre explained that there should be adoption of AI, but with \"stricter development and deployment guidelines.\"\\xa0      \"We cannot allow AI to steer itself and to steer us. There has to be a human-centered approach,\" he stressed.      To achieve a human-centered approach, Alegre advocates for mitigating discrimination and bias, along with increased transparency, data protection, and a robust framework for certification, compliance audits, and accountability.      Meanwhile, Emmanuel Lallana, chief executive of IdeaCorp Inc., warned of \"anthropomorphism\", emphasizing that AI is \"not about creating a human being,\" but rather examining its models and algorithms.      \"If you first understand the technology, then we\\'ll probably be in a better world,\" Lallana said.  - with reports from Angelica Paller/Rappler.com        Editor\\'s note: A previous version of the current article named Alan Alegre as the current executive director of the Foundation for Media Alternatives. He is the former executive director. This has been corrected.    '"

       "'  Recognizing the evolving digital landscape shaped by technical advancements and socio-technical realities, professionals discussed the impact of digital advancements on Philippine democracy and rights in the Philippine Declaration of Internet Rights and Principles (PhilDec 2.0).      The plenary session of the Digital Rights Conference, held at Ateneo de Manila University last Thursday, March 21, also featured discussions on several key points, including artificial intelligence (AI), human rights, gender, environmental sustainability, and the post-pandemic digital ecosystems.      Alan Alegre, former executive director of the Foundation for Media Alternatives (FMA), along with other information and communications technology (ICT), media and human rights experts, stressed the need for an updated declaration. It addresses challenges made more difficult by the digital economy, such as the digital divide, hijacked democracies, disinformation, and the post-pandemic effects on digital rights and health.      \"The digital economy as we were looking at it in 2015 has changed so much, both from what is developed technologically but also politically,\" Alegre said.\\xa0      In a 14-page draft, Alegre highlighted several newly added principles: addressing disinformation and harmful content to mitigate the harms to democracy and the digital public sphere; the sustainable use of the internet and ICTs amid the climate emergency; addressing power imbalances in digital societies through regulation, content moderation, and transparency; promoting more effective and equitable e-health systems; ICT systems and electoral integrity; and challenges posed by AI.      PhilDec 2.0 also included revisions from the  initial declaration  from 2015, emphasizing: open access to scientific, research, and academic content; addressing gender-based violence online through concrete programs and mechanisms to foster a transformative and safe internet space; and promoting human capital development through education, digital literacy, and e-learning including AI literacy.\\xa0      Alegre expressed hope that PhilDec 2.0 would become a \"strategic reference\" for various stakeholders, guiding its use in public education, policy development, social and political advocacy, and efforts related to gender and AI.      Potentials and perils of AI      Discussing AI literacy, Alegre said the education system is \"broken,\" calling it a challenge that needs to be addressed. Online learning, he added, exacerbated the challenges, revealing disparities in internet access as people share gadgets in barangays and schools.      The Philippines scored among the lowest in the December 2023  Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2022 rankings , placing 77th out of 81 countries. Filipino students continued to struggle in reading, mathematics, and science, positioning the nation near the bottom in these key subjects.      \"It\\'s a challenge, (but) we have to start somewhere, and the specific area of digital is important to build capacity strategically on all levels [such as] literacy, life-long learning, higher education, etc.,\" Alegre said.      For Dominic Ligot, founder of CirroLytix and Data Ethics PH, AI needs to \"become real and tangible to everyone\" as it represents the next evolution of the internet, particularly generative AI.      Ligot advocated the use of AI \"for good\" by starting with risk management. This included recommendations for a discussion on the harms versus benefits of AI, its compliance with laws, and moral principles and guidelines governing the development and deployment of the use of AI technologies.\\xa0      \" Ethics talaga ang bottomline. (Ethics really is the bottomline) , Ligot said. \"Is it fair, is it transparent, and who is accountable? If we can cover those three bases, maybe we can make a difference.\" he added.      Alegre addressed AI\\'s potential perils across economic, political, social, and environmental spheres, including job displacement, algorithmic bias, discrimination, privacy erosion, and the weaponization of AI, especially concerning elections, privacy, and gender issues. This underscores the necessity of a \"human-centered approach\" in AI development and deployment for its promised \"innovation.\"      Towards a ‘human-centered\\' approach      Despite concerns about AI, Alegre explained that there should be adoption of AI, but with \"stricter development and deployment guidelines.\"\\xa0      \"We cannot allow AI to steer itself and to steer us. There has to be a human-centered approach,\" he stressed.      To achieve a human-centered approach, Alegre advocates for mitigating discrimination and bias, along with increased transparency, data protection, and a robust framework for certification, compliance audits, and accountability.      Meanwhile, Emmanuel Lallana, chief executive of IdeaCorp Inc., warned of \"anthropomorphism\", emphasizing that AI is \"not about creating a human being,\" but rather examining its models and algorithms.      \"If you first understand the technology, then we\\'ll probably be in a better world,\" Lallana said.  - with reports from Angelica Paller/Rappler.com        Editor\\'s note: A previous version of the current article named Alan Alegre as the current executive director of the Foundation for Media Alternatives. He is the former executive director. This has been corrected.    '"

       "'  MANILA, Philippines - More than 400 Christians gathered at Bantayog ng mga Bayani, a  memorial for victims  of the Marcos dictatorship, to celebrate the resurrection of Christ in the face of the Philippines\\' problems under the second Marcos presidency.      The 61-year-old National Council of Churches in the Philippines (NCCP), the largest alliance of Christian churches in this predominantly Catholic country, held its 75th Ecumenical Easter Sunrise Service at the Bantayog ng mga Bayani from 4:30 to 7 am on Easter Sunday, March 31.      In this Easter service, various prayer leaders took turns in praying to the \"God of freedom\" for \"genuine justice and peace,\" for the safety of Filipino fishermen in the face of China\\'s bullying in the West Philippine Sea, and for assistance to migrants and workers.      The prayers at the ecumenical service also sought to uphold the rights of indigenous people and cultural communities against \"exploitative and oppressive systems,\" to defend women \"amid patriarchy and a feudal system,\" and to open the eyes of Christians to \"the realities of our LGBTQIA+ community.\"\\xa0      NCCP, known for its activist stance, is at the forefront of fighting government abuses, such as the Duterte administration\\'s war on drugs. This comes at a steep price: its members  have been red-tagged .        MEETING SUNRISE. The Easter service of the National Council of Churches in the Philippines is held from 4 to 7 am on March 31, 2024. Photo by Angie de Silva/Rappler       \"Talking about Jesus\\' Lordship is about challenging the powers that are lording over us,\" said NCCP chairperson Bishop Melzar Labuntog in his homily on Sunday.      Labuntog, who is also the general secretary of the United Church of Christ in the Philippines, noted how Jesus \"was killed because of His passion for a different kind of world.\" In this world, he said, \"the good news is proclaimed to the poor,\" and there is freedom for prisoners and the oppressed, and recovery of sight to the blind.      \"To declare that Jesus is alive means that the hungry are given food, the homeless are being sheltered, the poor are being cared for,\" Labuntog said.      ‘Resurrection is hope\\'      In an interview with Rappler, Labuntog said it was significant that the NCCP was holding its Easter service at Bantayog ng mga Bayani because it memorializes \"heroes of the faith who have given their lives for a very worthy cause\" during the Marcos dictatorship.      Labuntog said that under the dictator\\'s son, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., the nation\\'s problems still include poverty, low wages, and high prices of goods. Churches should stay involved in social issues like these because \"God is involved in the lives of the people.\"        PROPHETIC VOICE. Bishop Melzar Labuntog, chairperson of the National Council of Churches in the Philippines.       Also explaining why the NCCP chose to celebrate Easter at Bantayog ng mga Bayani, NCCP general secretary Minnie Anne Mata-Calub said that former NCCP members - such as their former general secretary, peace advocate Bishop La Verne Mercado - are among the names on the Bantayog wall of remembrance.\\xa0      The ambience of the Bantayog helps explain what Easter means for Christian churches, she added.      \"Easter, as the resurrection of Jesus Christ, also gives hope that in the middle of all the chaos and problems in our society, there is hope - because resurrection is hope for us,\" she told Rappler in a mix of English and Filipino.\\xa0      Dr. Gay Manodon, deacon of the Episcopal Church in the Philippines, also said Easter means hope - which is important in the fight against amending the country\\'s Constitution. \"Imagine giving 100% ownership of our land, communications, and education to foreigners,\" she said in a mix of English and Filipino. \"There is hope that this will not happen.\"      What they want to tell Marcos      Bishop Dindo Ranojo, general secretary of the Iglesia Filipina Independiente or the Aglipayan Church, said in a separate interview that churches should not keep quiet on social problems, and should instead serve as \"modern prophets\" who give hope to people.         CHRISTIAN YOUTH. Young Christians perform during the 75th Ecumenical Easter Sunrise Service of the National Council of Churches in the Philippines, March 31, 2024. Photo by Angie de Silva/Rappler       When asked about the biggest challenges under the Marcos presidency, Ranojo said in Filipino: \"First, we need to continue the peace talks, fight for the West Philippine Sea, boost our agriculture, and look after the welfare of citizens, workers, farmers, and most of all the indigenous people... because the environment is our capital for our a better future.\"      If given an opportunity to speak with Marcos, Ranojo said: \"First, he should listen to the voice of the people. Second, he should pay attention to what is really happening and remedy the problems of our society.\"      Bishop Rex Reyes of the Episcopal Church in the Philippines said that Christ \"is understood from a prophetic standpoint\" by the NCCP. \"You challenge the status quo, and the essence of Easter sunrise is to galvanize that mobilization,\" Reyes said.      Rappler asked Reyes, like Ranojo, about his message to Marcos if he gets the chance to address the President.      \" Ay naku  (Oh my gosh), I wouldn\\'t know how to address that guy,\" said Reyes, who was a high school student when the President\\'s father declared Martial Law. \"Until this time, I am still reeling from the impact of that rule.\"      Reyes noted how the President \"comes out with things that are similar to what his dad used,\" like his slogan \"Bagong Pilipinas\" (New Philippines), which is similar to the \"Bagong Lipunan\" (New Society) of the Martial Law years. He also cited the President\\'s  own version of his father\\'s Masagana 99  for boosting agriculture. \"What the heck,\" the bishop said.      \"I would think twice about addressing him. I don\\'t like to talk to him,\" Reyes said.      Toward the end of the interview, he pointed to the black marble walls where the names of Martial Law victims are inscribed at the Bantayog ng mga Bayani. \"The fact that we celebrate this observance amid those great names there, is very important for me,\" he added.      \"Those are heroes. Those are not just names,\" the bishop said.  - Rappler.com   '"
